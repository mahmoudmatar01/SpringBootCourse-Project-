## Overview

Provide a high-level overview of your project. Explain its purpose, key features, and any other relevant information.

## What is Spring

[Spring](https://spring.io/) is a comprehensive framework for building enterprise Java applications. It provides a modular and cohesive approach to developing Java applications, promoting best practices such as dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming. Key features of the Spring framework include:

- **Inversion of Control (IoC):** Spring promotes IoC, where the control of object creation and lifecycle is shifted from the application code to the Spring container. This leads to loosely coupled components and easier unit testing.

- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Spring facilitates DI, allowing developers to inject dependencies into a class rather than creating them within the class. This promotes reusability and easier management of components.

- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):** AOP in Spring enables developers to separate cross-cutting concerns, such as logging and transaction management, from the core business logic. This leads to cleaner and more maintainable code.

- **Data Access:** Spring provides robust support for data access through JDBC and ORM frameworks like Hibernate. It simplifies database transactions and offers a consistent approach to data access.

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** The Spring MVC framework is a part of the larger Spring framework and provides a flexible and customizable way to develop web applications.

- **Security:** Spring Security is a powerful and customizable authentication and access control framework that integrates seamlessly with Spring-based applications.

## Problem with Spring

While Spring is a powerful framework, it comes with some challenges that developers may face:

### 1. **Huge Framework:**
   Spring is a comprehensive framework, and for smaller projects, it may be perceived as overly complex due to its extensive feature set. This can result in a steeper learning curve and increased development time.

### 2. **Multiple Setup Steps:**
   Setting up a Spring project involves configuring various components, which can lead to a longer setup time. Developers may need to understand and configure XML or Java-based configuration files, leading to a potential source of errors.

### 3. **Multiple Configuration Steps:**
   Configuring Spring components, such as beans and aspects, requires careful consideration and understanding of the Spring configuration options. This complexity can lead to configuration errors and make troubleshooting more challenging.

### 4. **Multiple Build and Deploy Steps:**
   Building and deploying a Spring application can involve multiple steps, especially in larger projects. Understanding the intricacies of the build process, managing dependencies, and deploying to different environments may add complexity to the development workflow.

It's essential to note that these challenges can be mitigated with proper documentation, best practices, and tools designed to simplify the development process.

## Enter Spring Boot

[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is a framework built on top of the Spring framework, designed to simplify the development of production-ready applications with Spring. Here are some key characteristics of Spring Boot:

### 1. **Opinionated:**
   Spring Boot is opinionated, meaning it comes with predefined conventions and defaults. This allows developers to quickly set up projects without spending time on extensive configuration.

### 2. **Convention Over Configuration:**
   Following the convention over configuration principle, Spring Boot eliminates the need for explicit configuration in many cases. It assumes sensible defaults, reducing the amount of boilerplate code.

### 3. **Stand Alone:**
   Spring Boot applications are stand-alone, meaning they can be run as executable JARs with an embedded server. This simplifies deployment and reduces the need for external web servers.

### 4. **Production Ready:**
   Spring Boot includes production-ready features out of the box, such as health checks, metrics, and monitoring through the Spring Boot Actuator. This ensures that applications built with Spring Boot are well-prepared for deployment in production environments.

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can " Just Run ".

## Spring Boot Features

### 1. **Opinionated Defaults:**
   Spring Boot comes with sensible defaults for configuration, reducing the need for manual setup. It follows the convention over configuration principle, enabling developers to start projects quickly with minimal configuration.

### 2. **Embedded Servers:**
   Spring Boot includes embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow, making it easy to deploy applications as standalone JARs without the need for an external web server.

### 3. **Auto-Configuration:**
   Spring Boot automatically configures common components based on the project's dependencies. This feature significantly reduces the need for explicit configuration and boilerplate code.

### 4. **Spring Boot Starters:**
   Starters are pre-configured templates that streamline the integration of various technologies (e.g., databases, and messaging systems) into your Spring Boot application. They simplify dependency management and configuration.

### 5. **Spring Boot Actuator:**
   The actuator provides production-ready features like health checks, metrics, and monitoring out of the box. It helps developers and administrators monitor and manage Spring Boot applications easily.

### 6. **Spring Boot DevTools:**
   DevTools offers features like automatic application restart, live reload, and remote debugging, making the development process more efficient and enjoyable.
