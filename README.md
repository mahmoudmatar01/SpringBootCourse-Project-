# Spring Boot Course 

## Overview

Provide a high-level overview of your project. Explain its purpose, key features, and any other relevant information.

## What is Spring Boot

[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is a framework for building Java-based enterprise applications. It simplifies the development process by providing production-ready default configurations for various components, allowing developers to focus more on business logic and less on boilerplate code. Spring Boot is known for its convention-over-configuration approach, which means you get sensible defaults without having to configure everything manually.

## Spring Boot Features

### 1. **Opinionated Defaults:**
   Spring Boot comes with sensible defaults for configuration, reducing the need for manual setup. It follows the convention over configuration principle, enabling developers to start projects quickly with minimal configuration.

### 2. **Embedded Servers:**
   Spring Boot includes embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow, making it easy to deploy applications as standalone JARs without the need for an external web server.

### 3. **Auto-Configuration:**
   Spring Boot automatically configures common components based on the project's dependencies. This feature significantly reduces the need for explicit configuration and boilerplate code.

### 4. **Spring Boot Starters:**
   Starters are pre-configured templates that streamline the integration of various technologies (e.g., databases, messaging systems) into your Spring Boot application. They simplify dependency management and configuration.

### 5. **Spring Boot Actuator:**
   Actuator provides production-ready features like health checks, metrics, and monitoring out of the box. It helps developers and administrators monitor and manage Spring Boot applications easily.

### 6. **Spring Boot DevTools:**
   DevTools offer features like automatic application restart, live reload, and remote debugging, making the development process more efficient and enjoyable.
